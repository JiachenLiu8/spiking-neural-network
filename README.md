# Spiking Neural Network for Sound Localization

## Description
This project implements a spiking neural network (SNN) using surrogate gradient descent to solve the problem of sound localization. It is developed in C and C++ and is designed to simulate the way biological neural networks process auditory information to determine the direction of sound. This repository includes both the core algorithms implemented in a simplified neural network framework and a set of utility functions for matrix operations essential for neural computation.

## Features
- **Surrogate Gradient Descent**: Implements a custom gradient approach for non-differentiable neuron models.
- **Spiking Neural Network**: Simulates neural spiking behavior mimicking biological auditory processing.
- **Sound Localization**: Demonstrates how neural networks can be trained to determine the direction of sound based on simulated auditory inputs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- GCC compiler (Version 7 or higher recommended)
- Make (for building the project)
- Basic understanding of neural networks and C/C++ programming

## Acknowledgments
- Inspired by the research, publications and lectures of Dan Goodman and Friedemann Zenke.
